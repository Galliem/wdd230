            <p>This website uses the design principle of White Space and Clean Design.
                Throughout the page, they have professional photos of their products with buttons
                and links to let the user learn more or shop for the desired product. This site
                uses white space to help thier organization be more pleasant to view.

            <p><img src="images/apple.png"></p>
            <p>This website uses the design principle of PARC: Contrast. The image above shows a
                 dark image with the webpage having a white background. Apple keeps to a very simple 
                and high in contrast color pallet.</p>

            <h3>Website 3</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a></p>
            <p><img src="images/pinterest.png"></p>
            <p>Pinterest's website uses the design principle of Visual Hierarchy. They make the pins
                as the larger items on the site. They make sure that their algarithm shows the viewer
                what they want to see instead of showing more words and details. Users can click on the 
                pins to access more of the hidden details.
